# We Hack Purple - Applicaiton Security 1

## Application Security Goals
- Inventory 
    1. Take a complete inventory of all software. APIs, WebApps, Serverless, etc.. 
    2. Keeping track of all web assets is extremely valuable. 
- Finding Vulnerabilities
    1. In running code, written code, 3rd party code (libraries, plug-in's). 
    2. Ability to quickly fix issues. 
- Knowledge to fix what has been found
    1. Developer Education, supporting documentation, etc. 
    2. Modernize and learn to eliminate bugs (ex. cross site scripting)
- Effective Tooling
    1. Which tools do we need, and how do we select them? Proof of concept on 3+ tools. 
    2. Automate as much as possible. Part of ci/cd pipleline, scan monthly, etc. 
- Education and Reference Materials
    1. Technical library, Online training, Formal training, Lunch and Learn
    2. Advocacy Program, Security champions program 
- Give Developoers Security Tools
    1. Scan apps
    2. Fix criticals and highs
    3. Send to security for more indepth testing
    4. Put power into software developers hands (self service)
    5. Possibly write own tools, libraries, frameworks
- Security Activities during SDLC (software development life cycle)
    1. Add to each stage of SDLC
    2. Requirements, Design, Coding, Testing, Deployment, Maintenance
    3. Little activites make a big difference
    4. Security sprint
    5. Partnership model (security engineer is assigned to help team)
- Incident Response
    1. IR team understands AppSec or knows when to call the AppSec team
    2. Implement tooling to prevent or detect 
    3. Job specific training for each team in IT 
    4. Why they sould turn over to AppSec (prevent accidental harm)
- Continuous Improvement
    1. Ways of DevOps
        - Emphasize efficiency of entire system
        - Have really fast feedback
        - Continuous Improvement
    2. Metrics, Experimentation, Feedback
    3. Looking for patterns and trends
    4. Discuss with Dev team on how to improve (quarterly?)
